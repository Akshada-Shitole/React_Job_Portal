JOB LISTING PORTAL

This is just a static website of job portal.
I have madhe this using HTML,CSS,JavaScript,ReactJS.
There are various tabs available such as home,about us,contact us,View jobs,add jobs etc.
For this demo task:
The tabs are currently disable and I have tried to show all the tabs information in a same page.
React and React-dom is used to make Graphical User Interface more awesome.

The CSS file contains all the styles.
The index.js file contains the javascript code as well as react code.all the main code is written with the 
index.js file.
The index.html just contains root component.
In the entire project just the single root component is used.

As this a demo project I have just tried to show main elements.
